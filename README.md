# Introduction to Data Visualization in R
Workshop materials and instructions for the 2023-09-12 *Introduction to Data Visualization in R* virtual workshop, led by JHU Data Services. 

This workshop introduces data visualization in R using base R and `ggplot2`. In this hands-on workshop, we cover design concepts of data visualization and popular R packages, before diving into creating data visualizations for a prepared dataset using base R and ggplot2.

## Pre-Class Instructions

### Software Installation
- If you haven’t already, make sure you have downloaded and installed the following software: 
	- R - https://cran.r-project.org/
	- RStudio - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (Download “RStudio Desktop”, not “RStudio Server”)
- If it’s been a while since you’ve used R or R Studio, no worries! But check your versions and consider updating if you’re several versions behind.

### Software Setup
In this workshop, we’ll be using a number of R packages. Please try to install them prior to the workshop starting, as some of these packages can take a while to install. 
Make sure you’ve installed the following R packages:

- **ggplot2** (for plotting)
- **palmerpenguins** (our data)
- **RColorBrewer** (for generating colorblind friendly color palettes)

To install the packages, use the following commands in your R console:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
```
